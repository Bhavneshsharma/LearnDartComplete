/*
* var : var stands for variable and variable value can be change any time.
* final :  final is replacement of val in kotlin.
* const : const to declare compile-time constants, which are also immutable like
  final variables. However, const is more restrictive than final because its value must be known at compile-time.

* late : late is dart is just like lateinit and lazy in Kotlin.
      * Declaring a non-nullable variable thatâ€™s initialized after its declaration.
      * Lazily initializing a variable.

* int : int is used for make integer value variable
* double : double is used for make float & double value but in dart there is no float.
